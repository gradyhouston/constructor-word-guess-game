A command line version of the classic Hangman game built using Node.js, Inquirer, cli-color, and JavaScript constructors.

To play, clone the repo, run ```node index.js``` in your terminal, enter your name, decide if you're ready to play...

And then try to guess the letters of the countries of the world! You have 12 guesses.

Good luck.
